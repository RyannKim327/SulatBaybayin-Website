			<blockquote>
				&emsp;Baybayin is one of the Philippines' ancient scriptures and forms of writing. Baybayin is just one of at least 16 different writing systems that were used in pre-colonial Philippines, a fairly lost era of before the advent of European intervention. The character-based alphabet was used in pre-colonial times and have shown a sudden spike of resurgence in the country's modern era. <a href="https://owlcation.com/humanities/Learn-how-to-type-write-and-read-baybayin">Source</a>

			<blockquote>
				&emsp;Baybayin is a pre-Spanish Philippine writing system. It is a member of the Brahmic family and is recorded as being in use in the 16th century. It continued to be used during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines up until the late 19th Century.

				&emsp;The term Baybay literally means “to spell” in Tagalog. Baybayin was extensively documented by the Spanish. Some have attributed it the name Alibata, but this name is incorrect. (The term “Alibata” was coined by Paul Rodriguez Verzosa after the arrangement of letters of the Arabic alphabet alif, ba, ta (alibata), “f” having been eliminated for euphony’s sake.” ) Versoza’s reasoning for creating this word was unfounded because no evidence of the baybayin was ever found in that part of the Philippines and it has absolutely no relationship to the Arabic language. Furthermore, no ancient script native to Southeast Asia followed the Arabic arrangement of letters, and regardless of Versoza’s connection to the word alibata, its absence from all historical records indicates that it is a totally modern creation. The present author does not use this word in reference to any ancient Philippine script. For further more, kindly visit <a href="https://mandirigma.org/?p=423">Mandirigma.org</a>
