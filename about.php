This application is under X edition, which means two editional series implied in this application. The idea of this application is just came from a request from a member of Android World (Full of Experience). First well developed is just a font based, which means, when you typed a, the corresponding output is "<b>ᜀ</b>". Until an hour past by, there's a discovery under the the development, it was ascii type font, so it means, roman characters and baybayin characters are too different with.</p>

			<h3>About the organization</h3>

		<p>&emsp;Way back September 3 2016, the HangDroid PH was build, it was named after a friend called the founder HangDroid. It was build for aspiring modders and remodders of application around our province. December 2016, the MPOP or <label>M</label>aster <label>P</label>iece <label>O</label>f <label>P</label>aper's name was came from an activity from a teacher in MAPeH named Joewel Anareta. He said that, "Create a master piece in a piece of paper". The idea was developed and named Master Piece of Paper, as we modify from a scratch. The MPOP Modifiers Group was published around December 2016 to March 2017. As you've noticed the HangDroid PH has exact date, it's because I've been under sickness on the month of August 2017, where Batangas was one of the province under dengue surge. And I was cured on September 3 2016. Way back April 2018, Team ModDev was published through the public, as the tagline <b>We Modify, We Developed, We Share, We Credits</b>. I was one of the newbie aspiring developer in the Philippines that time. I've developed HangDroid Browser Beta, as making Team ModDev and MPOP Modifiers Group under the name of HangDroid PH, and named HangDroid MobileTech inc. This time MPOP Modifiers Group were renamed as MPOP Reverse II.</p>
